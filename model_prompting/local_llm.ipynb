      "Generating a ligand that specifically interacts with a given protein sequence involves considering the structural and functional elements of both the protein and potential ligands. Here’s a general approach to designing such a ligand, followed by an example SMILES representation:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Steps for Ligand Design:\n",
      "1. **Sequence Analysis**: Identify key residues in the protein that are likely involved in binding interactions. These could be hydrophobic regions, charged amino acids, or specific structural features like pockets or clefts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ligand Selection**: Choose a ligand with functional groups that can interact with these key residues. This might include:\n",
      "   - **Hydrogen Bonds**: Amino groups (-NH2), carboxyl groups (-COOH), or hydroxyl groups (-OH).\n",
      "   - **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Aliphatic and aromatic groups like CH3, C6H5.\n",
      "   - **Electrostatic Interactions**: Positive or negative charges that can interact with charged residues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Size Consideration**: Ensure the ligand is not too large (molecular weight < 500 Da) to fit into potential binding sites without being sterically hindered.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Complexity Management**: Avoid overly complex structures that might be difficult to synthesize or have low bioavailability.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example SMILES Representation:\n",
      "For a hypothetical protein sequence, let’s assume it has a pocket that can accommodate an aromatic ring and hydrogen bond acceptor groups like hydroxyls. A possible ligand could be:\n",
