Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Task Explanation:
   - You are NOT generating the SMILES representation of the protein itself.
   - Instead, you are generating the SMILES representation of a small molecule (ligand) that binds to the protein with high binding affinity.

2. Rules for Correct Generation:
   - The ligand must have functional groups that can form hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, or other binding mechanisms with the protein.
   - Avoid generating molecules that are too large (molecular weight > 500 Da) or too complex.
   - Consider the properties of the protein sequence (e.g., hydrophobicity, charge) when generating the ligand.
   - If the predicted binding affinity is low, regenerate a different ligand with better interaction potential.

3. Output Format:
   - Always respond in the following format:
     Correct molecular structure: <SMILES>
   - Do not add extra explanations after the SMILES.
